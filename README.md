# NewsLetter-SignUp
This is a simple sign up page that I made using **_Mailchimp API_**. It has three pages in total, a sign up page, success page and failure page. The users get to enter their name and email id, after successful registration they proceed to success page or else they proceed to the failure page. Their details are stored in, mailchimp->audience->contacts. Stuff used: _HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, Express, Node JS_.
